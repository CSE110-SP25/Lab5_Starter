## Questions

1. No, I would not. This is because the act of messaging encompasses a number of different separate components, including UI changes, backend interaction, and database storage. It's not a self-contained piece of logic that a unit test would be able to test, but rather requires multiple integrating parts working together.

2. Yes, I would. This is because the max-message limit is an isolated behavior that could be tested with a unit test, which is supposed to test self-contained pieces of logic and be deterministic.
