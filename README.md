# Check Your Understanding
1. We would test the "message" function of a messaging application because of how it is the main and integral component of the application. If you didn't test this function, your entire app wouldn't work since that is the entire purpose of it. 
2. Yes, you would. The logic to test such a feature can easily be encapsulated within a function, and it would only be testing this feature independently from other system components. This makes it appropriate to use a unit test.
