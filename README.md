1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not?

No, unit test should not be use to test the “message” feature because sending a message involves multiple components working together. This is should be used for integration.

1) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not?

Yes, unit test should be use to test the “max message length” feature because it’s an isolated rule which can be tested independently without involving the rest of the system.
